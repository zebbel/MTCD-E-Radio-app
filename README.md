# MTCD-E-Radio-app

This is a very simple version of the Radio App for MTCD/E Android radios.

It is intended to create your own radio app without reverse engineering the original app.

The app uses a SQlite database to provide station logos based on the RDS signal.

A Python file is included to create the database.
