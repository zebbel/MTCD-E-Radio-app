README File for RDSDX List Files 



Hello,

thank you for downloading .lst files from FMLIST for use with RDSDX!
Please copy the .lst files into the \rdsdx\ListFiles directory. Existing files can be overwritten.


Please let us have your log files, created with RDSDX, for statistical purposes and for evaluation of propagation conditions.


Please send your unmodified log files, labelled with LOG DATE, and let us know your time zone and listening location (please give your coordinates, if possible) to

		fmlist@lorenzsoft.de

If you agree that your log data is made available in FMLIST and on propagation maps, please also include the following statement in your mail:

"I agree that my log data, my name and my listening coordinates may be made available within FMLIST!"


If you have any questions, suggestions or would like to report errors or omissions, please also write to the above address.



For the world-wide team of FMLIST editors, contributors and users,

Günter Lorenz
FMLIST database administration
